 Given a roman numeral as input, write a function that converts the roman numeral to a number and outputs it.

 > Example:

 `translateRomanNumeral("LX") // 60`

 When a smaller numeral appears before a larger one, it becomes a subtractive operation. You can assume only one smaller numeral may appear in front of larger one.

 > Example 2:

 `translateRomanNumeral("IV") // 4`
