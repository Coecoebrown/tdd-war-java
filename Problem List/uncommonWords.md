  We are given two sentences A and B.  (A sentence is a string of space separated words.  Each word consists only of lowercase letters.)

  A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

  Return a list of all uncommon words.

> Examples:

  Input:
  ```
  A = "this apple is sweet"

  ```

  Output: `["sweet","sour"]`

  ```
  A = "apple apple"
